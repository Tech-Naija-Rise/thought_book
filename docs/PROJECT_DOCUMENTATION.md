# Thought Book Documentation

## Overview

**Thought Book** is a fast, offline-first, and private note-taking application for Windows. It is designed to provide users with a secure, modern, and easy-to-use space to capture and manage their thoughts without relying on the internet or cloud services. The app emphasizes privacy, simplicity, and speed, making it ideal for users who want instant access to their notes and complete control over their data.

## Features

- **Local Storage & Encryption:** All notes are stored locally in an encrypted SQLite database. No data is sent to the cloud by default.
- **Password Protection & Recovery:** Users set a password and a recovery code to protect access to their notes. Passwords are securely hashed.
- **Modern UI:** Built with CustomTkinter, the app offers a clean, intuitive interface with sidebar navigation and auto-save functionality.
- **Freemium Model:** Free users can create up to 5 notes. Premium users unlock unlimited notes and additional features by purchasing a license key.
- **Installer & Shortcuts:** The project includes scripts to build a Windows installer and create desktop/start menu shortcuts with a global hotkey for quick access.
- **Feedback & Licensing:** Integrated feedback system allows users to send suggestions or bug reports. License management enables premium upgrades.
- **Optional Backup:** Users can back up their notes to Google Drive or other locations, with step-by-step instructions provided.
- **Auto-Updater:** The app can check for updates and install new versions automatically.
